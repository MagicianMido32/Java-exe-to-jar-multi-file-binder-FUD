# Java exe to jar multi-file binder FUD
 Java exe to jar multi-file binder FUD

binds several exe files into a jar file, by converting  them into separated byte arrays them combining them in runtime, you can specify the directory to drop the files as well as which files to execute.
The result is FUD.

Important: your binded-files are going to be dropped as they are, so if they are not fud, the drop process is going to be detected.

The binder itself is fud.
